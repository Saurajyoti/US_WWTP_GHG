Purpose: The purpose of this repository is to use data from a variety of sources, primarily various releases of the Clean Watersheds Needs Survey (CWNS), to create a dataframe of active wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the United States for a specified year and assign one or more treatment trains to each wastewater treatment plant based on *A Guide to Net-Zero Energy Solutions for Water Resource Recovery Facilities* (Tarallo et al., 2015).
