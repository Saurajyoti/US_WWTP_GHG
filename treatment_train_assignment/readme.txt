Purpose: Purpose: The purpose of this notebook is to use data from a variety of sources, primarily various releases of the Clean Watersheds Needs Survey (CWNS), to create a dataframe of active wastewater treatment plants in the United States as of 2022. In addition to including flow rate, this dataframe also contains one or more treatment train assignments for each wastewater treatment plant based on A Guide to Net-Zero Energy Solutions for Water Resource Recovery Facilities (Tarallo et al., 2015). Treatment train assignments are ultimately used to estimate baseline energy consumption/generation and greenhouse gas emissions on a national scale from wastewater treament facilities.
