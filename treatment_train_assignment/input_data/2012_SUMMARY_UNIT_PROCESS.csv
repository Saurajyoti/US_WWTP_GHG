The abandoned chlorine contact tank will be converted into a septage pumping station to pump the septage up to the abandoned clarifiers which will be converted into septage holding tanks. A new dumping station consisting of a 4' x 6' precast concrete structure would be located at the southwest corner of the abandoned chlorine contact tank just off the access road for use by the septage hauler for dumping and the operators for screening.,10/23/2012,,,,
